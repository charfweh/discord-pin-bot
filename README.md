Introducing pin bot, a discord bot which helps load your pinned messages into a separate channel keeping it safe and sound
#### :mega: A word on Permissions:

- @everyone : deny ``send message``, allow ``read message``<br>

You can edit channel's permission as you like but dont remove whats already been set, or open your
arms for warm errors that befall<br>
