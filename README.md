Reached pinned message cap? you cant pin more or<br>
can you?<br>
###### Introducing pin bot, a discord bot which helps load your pinned messages into a separate channel keeping it safe and sound
#### A word on Permissions:

- @everyone : deny send message, allow read message<br>

- set_bot: Limited to members with Administrator Permission<br>

- pins: Limited to members with Administrator Permission<br>

You can edit channel's permission as you like but dont remove whats already been set, or open your
arms for warm errors that befall<br>
To not let guild members misuse pin log channel, we apply permissions which define whoâ€™ll get access to this channel.

#### Commands available

- ``pins``: Loads this channel's pinned message into a channel called pins under category Pinned archive

- ``set_bot``:Starts the bot setup, all the necessary configuration needed to run commands will be executed by this command, Iknow you dont wanna read it but still I'll mention it anyway, so what this will do is make a category and a channel namely, "pinned archive" and "pins" overwrite permissions in these and you're good to go

- ``invite``:Invite link for the bot

- ``ping``: Bot's latency

- ``help``:Shows available commands
